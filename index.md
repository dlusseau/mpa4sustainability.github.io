<h2> Enhancing MPAs’ role in restoring biodiversity while maintaining access to ecosystem services - a [BIODIVERSA](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2022/10/25/mpa4sustainability/) project </h2>

<p> You can find more about the objectives and work ongoing in this project in the about page.</p>
<p> This website is dedicated to dissemination. You can find links to the data we generate, our code and our publications. </p>
<p> The Decision Support System will also be hosted on this website at the end of the project. </p>

        <h3>programme of work</h3>
           <div class="justified-text">
            <p>this project is composed of four interdisciplinary work packages which aim to understand how people and nature interact at MPA sites and learn lessons about practices which can help assure that biodiversity objectives are addressed at those sites</p>

        <h3>3 case studies</h3>
        <div class="justified-text">
        <p>We work with local partners directly involved in MPA management in three locations selected for their complexity and their maturity</p>

        <h3>Relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services</h3>
        <p>We estimate 16,000+ Species-human pressures networks at MPA sites to understand whether their structure differs under different MPA management and socioecological contexts</p>
       
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Modelling and prediction of ecosystem resilience under perturbations</h3>
        <p>we investigate how ecosystem services (ES) exploitation affects ecological dynamics and causes biodiversity and ES loss in MPAs and coastal systems</p>

        <h3>Intelligent monitoring</h3>
        <p>We wtest the use of ‘citizen monitoring’ and low cost eDNA sampling to monitor MPAs.</p>
         </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Integrative governance</h3>
        <p>We map synergies and conflicts among policy instruments and use network analyses to identify policies that can have disproportionate effects on others and identify direct and system-level conflicts among    
 policies</p>
